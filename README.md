# Bevy Shader Tutorial 

This is the code to follow the basic shader tutorial on the [LogicProjects Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT_D88-MTFOMNRPAC-62Hz096aIjT4Noy).  There are 3 branches that corespond to the 3 parts of the tutorial.  In part 1 a basic material is setup, in part 2 bind groups are used to get generic data and textures into the shader, finally in part 3 extract/prepare functions are used to get changing values from the game into the shader.

# Usage

```
cargo run
```
